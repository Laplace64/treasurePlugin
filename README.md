# Treasure plugin

This plugin allows for iron horse armors to act as metal detectors, making sounds with higher frequency as players get
closer to a treasure spot.
Players can use an iron shovel to dig at said shovel spots to gain loot.

## Building & Testing

The plugin can be built from `shadowJar` to pack Kotlin and dependencies together. For quick testing, `run-paper` plugin
provides the ability to choose `runServer` to launch a local Paper server with this plugin
